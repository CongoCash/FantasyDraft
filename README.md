# Fantasy Football Drafting App

This project is a basic fantasy football app where users can create leagues, join leagues, start live drafts, and view players' stats.

Users can make an account, log in and view all the available leagues that have been created and join them. They can also create their own leagues, of which they are the commisioner of. The commisioner can then start a draft where teams will pick in a snake draft order. In the draft room, users can live chat with each other, and when draft picks are made the page live updates for every user. Players are ordered by an editor's ranks, and all relevant stats are visible. Players can then view their teams, with all their players and stats.
